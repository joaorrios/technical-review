# Agent Skills

Portable skills for coding agents.

## Skills

- **approach-review** — challenges a proposed technical approach before implementation.
- **implementation-review** — inspects the technical aspects of a completed implementation before acceptance or shipping.
- **unhobble** — updates and simplifies context engineering for new, stronger models.

Each skill is independently installable and self-contained within its folder.

## Install

Install with the open Agent Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add joaorrios/agent-skills
```

Choose the skills you want when prompted. The CLI handles each supported coding agent's skill location.

```text
skills/
  approach-review/
    SKILL.md
    agents/
      reviewer.md
  implementation-review/
    SKILL.md
    agents/
      reviewer.md
  unhobble/
    SKILL.md
```

The two technical-review skills dispatch a fresh isolated reviewer using their bundled `agents/reviewer.md`. They work best in runtimes that can spawn an isolated subagent and optionally enforce a read-only boundary.

`unhobble` requires access to read and edit the target material and an independent reviewer.

## Technical review independence

The reviewer receives the artifact and coordinates needed to investigate the real system, not the author's reasoning, defenses, suspected weaknesses, or expected conclusions.

Written requirements and prior technical decisions are evidence of intent, not authority over technical correctness. A review may identify a defect even when the artifact faithfully follows what was written.

## Versioning

Agent Skills follows Semantic Versioning for the collection as a whole. Changesets records the intended bump for future changes:

```bash
npm run changeset
npm run version
```

Release tags use `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Versioning is independent from installation: `npx skills` installs and updates skills from the repository, while SemVer tags and releases identify published collection states.
